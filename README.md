# Hi! Asad Ali is here...

I am Computer Science student at COMSATS University Islamabad Lahore Campus. Programming is my passion. I have firm grip on programming courses like Programming Fundamentals, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Database. Recently I have started a web development course at Ideoversity Training Institute Lahore. This blog site is the implementation of what I have learned in the course till now. Looking Forward for building more dynamic and valuable websites in future.
