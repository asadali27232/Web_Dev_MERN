# Web_Dev_MERN

This repository contains the code for a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to create and manage their own profiles, create posts, and interact with other users by commenting on and liking their posts.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user information and post data
- Express: A web application framework used to handle server-side logic and routing
- React: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used to execute server-side code
- Redux: A state management library used to manage the application's state
- Bootstrap: A CSS framework used to style the user interface

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running:
```sh
npm install
```
Next, start the server by running:
```sh
npm run server
```
Then, start the React development server by running:
```sh
npm run start
```

You can access the application by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
